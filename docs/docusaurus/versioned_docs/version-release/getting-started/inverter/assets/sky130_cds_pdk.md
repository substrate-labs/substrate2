You will need to install the Cadence PDK by downloading it from the [Cadence support portal](https://support.cadence.com/apex/ArticleAttachmentPortal?id=a1Od000000051TqEAI&pageName=GPDKs).

Also, ensure that the `SKY130_CDS_PDK_ROOT` environment variable points to the location of the PDK you just installed.
