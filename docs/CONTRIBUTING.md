# Contributing

Thank you for contribting to Substrate!
This document outlines guidelines for Substrate contributors.

## Guidelines

* Within-repository Rust dependencies should specify **both** a path **and** a version number.
* Commit messages should follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
  The body of the commit message should describe the changes that were made.
  These messages will be aggregated into `CHANGELOG`s.
* All contributions should be submitted by opening a PR against this repository.
  If you do not have direct access to this repo, you should create a fork, make changes on your fork,
  and then submit your changes as a PR.
* After merging PRs, delete the branch.
